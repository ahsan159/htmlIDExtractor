# html_ID_Extractor
## 05-October-2022
This is my take on developing an extension that will search all the html documents in the active project and search the ID's. Then these ID's will be made available to autocomplete in intellisense while writing javascript code. 
My thinking is that this will speed up the development time specially for beginner's as switching between files is decreased. 
I have not checked for any existing tool. I am taking this opportunity to develop my understanding of visual studio code and javascript.
